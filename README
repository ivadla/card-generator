This is a card generator for dominion cards. It takes a template(svg), a card description (xml), 
an image for the card(svg, png or jpg) and a specification for the image and generates the card
as a svg-file.

Compile and Run:
----------------
Basically you just have to compile all the java files in the src directory 
and and create a jar file. The main class is just called Main. 

You can use ant to do that:
ant jar
Alternatively you can import this project into your favorite java IDE and compile it there. Make sure 
that you put the libraries in libs/ in your classpath.

To run the card generator use:

java -jar card-generator.jar <template> <image> <output directory> <card-xml>

<template>  is the xml file with the configuration of the template, or a directory which contains 
            such a file named config.xml. See data/example-template-config.xml
<image>	    the xml file describing the image, or a directory containing such a file with the same 
            name as the card, or a directory containing a directory with the name of the set to
            which the card belongs. The set directory should contain the image xml file with the same
            name as the card. See data/example-image.xml
<output directory> final svg file will be put in <output directory>/svg/<name of the set>/<cardname>.xml
<card-xml>  one or more xml files describing the cards. If it is a directory it will be search recursively
            for .xml files. data/cards/en_US/ contains all the official dominion cards released so far

Examples of templates and images can be found in the repository for the openclipart cards:

Creating new card descriptions

the cards in data/cards/en_US/ can be used as a template. For new official sets the class src/ParseDiehrstraitsCom.java
can be used to parse the descriptions form http://dominion.diehrstraits.com/
