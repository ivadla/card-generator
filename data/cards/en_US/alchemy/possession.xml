        <line>The player to your left takes an extra turn after this one, in which you can see all cards he can and make all decisions for him.</line>
        <line>Any cards he would gain on that turn, you gain instead; any cards of his that are trashed are set aside and returned to his discard pile at end of turn.</line>
